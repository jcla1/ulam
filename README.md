Spiral Matrix function for Ulam Spirals

The main function ulam([x,y], dimention) generates a spiral matrix of width and height -> dimention, and tells you what the value
is at position x, y in that matrix. Note that 1,1 is in the top left corner of a matrix. 
See [Ulam Spiral rectangular grid construction] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam_spiral#Construction) for more 
details. 

This was mostly a mental exercise.
